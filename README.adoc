== Django container usage
To build a container with a specific Django version modify `requirements.txt` in the project directory.

You can also build the container using a different directory entirely where you can have your own `requirements.txt`:

-------
$ docker build --build-arg PROJECT_DIR=<path-to-your-dir> . -t <name:tag>
-------

== Running the app
To run the app, first create a container off of the newly built image by running:

-------
$ docker run --name <name> -dit -p 8000:8000 <name:tag> /bin/bash
-------
When inside the container, move to the directory with the app and run the dev server:

-------
# cd /opt/app/podcastmanager/
# python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
-------
