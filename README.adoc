== Django container usage
To build a container with a specific Django version modify `requirements.txt` in the project directory.

You can also build the container using a different directory entirely where you can have your own `requirements.txt`:

-------
$ docker build --build-arg PROJECT_DIR=<path-to-your-dir> . -t <name:tag>
-------
